  h2 What the list contains
  p The list below is incomplete but contains some books that I considered good books that cover the topic they intended to nicely.  If you are interested in the topics, I recommend that you read them.   The date next to the books is not the published date, but the date that I read them.  They were relevant to technology in that year, maybe not anymore today.
