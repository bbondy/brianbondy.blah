  h2 Braille Information
  p Braille was invented by Louis Braille who was born in 1809 and lost his sight when he was 6.
  p Braille gives the blind the ability to read and do mathematics.

  h2 How Braille works
  p Braille consists of a series of raised dots. A braille cell consists of a '3 row x 2 column' grid. Anyone of these 6 dots can be raised to form different combinations. These combinations are interpreted to mean different characters, numbers, or groups of characters. There are 2^6 - 1 different possible symbols.  This is only 63, however some braille codes can be used in combination to form others making the possibilities endless.
  p One of my favorite composers Ray Charles, was blind at the age of 7.

  h2 Why I care?
  p I've always been interested in different ways to represent things, and different methods of communication.
  p For example, in my projects section I have a project on steganography (encoding data into normal images by using pixel color variations).

  h2 Braille Alphabet
  p In level 1 braille every letter has it's own braille code.

  h2 Braille Numbers
  p Braille numbers are actually the same as the letters. Except they have a special braille code that is used before them to signify that they're a number instead of a letter. 1 is a, 2 is b, 3 is c, ... , and 0 is j
