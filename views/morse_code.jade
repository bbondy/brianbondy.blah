  h2 Morse Code overview
  p Morse code has a 1-1 alphabetical to short/long beep code combo.
  p Morse code is a system of representing letters, numbers and punctuation marks by means of a code signal sent intermittently. It was developed by Alfred Vail while he was helping Samuel Morse with Morse's invention of the telegraph in 1835.
  p Morse code is an early form of digital communication, however unlike modern binary digital codes that use just two states (commonly represented as 1 and 0), it uses five: dot (Â·), dash (-), short gap (between each letter), medium gap (between words) and long gap (between sentences).
