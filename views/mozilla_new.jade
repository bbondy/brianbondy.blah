  h2 New to Mozilla
  p If you want to get into the Mozilla community, this page will help you get your foot in the door.  A Mozilla community member is called a Mozillian.  
  p: :markdown
    The best place to get involved is still by going through the [Mozilla contribute page](http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/).  This page will just summarize some starting points of getting involved.
  p People often become a Mozillian for a variety of reasons including: Wanting to help the project, wanting to develop their own skills, wanting to put something extra on their resume, or even wanting to get a job at Mozilla.

  h2 Find out where you belong
  p: :markdown
    Find out what you want to help with.  The best way to do that is by reading the [ways to contribute page](http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/areas.html).

  h2 Quality Assurance (QA) and testing
  p Here are some ways to get started with QA:

    li: :markdown
      [Confirm unconfirmed bugs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Confirming_unconfirmed_bugs).

    li Try to find a mentor who can help you along the way


  h2 Developers

  h2 Firefox builds
  p Mozilla Firefox has 4 different release channels: Release, Beta, Aurora, and Nightly.
  p The Firefox Release channel is the currently released Firefox version.   If Firefox Release was for example version 7, then Beta would be version 8, Aurora would be version 9, and Nightly would be version 10.  Every 6 weeks each of these channels shift one to the left and Nightly gets a new version, in my example Nightly would become version 11.
  p You can download the builds here:
  ul
    li: a(href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/?from=getfirefox') Firefox Release
    li: a(href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/') Firefox Beta
    li: a(href='http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/') Firefox Aurora
    li: a(href='http://nightly.mozilla.org/') Firefox Nightly
