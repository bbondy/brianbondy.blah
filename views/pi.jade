  h2 What is Pi?
  p Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This magical number appears almost everywhere in every type of math.  Pi cannot be written as the ratio of two numbers and is therefore an irrational number. Pi is also a transcendental number, which means that it is not the root of any polynomial equation with rational coefficients.
  p Many people make a hobby of trying to memorize as much of Pi as they can. The current record is held by Akira Haraguchi, who has memorized Pi to over 83 thousand digits.
